# 2026-02-08 — Phase 1 Close / Phase 2 Start

**Requested by:** Shayne Boyer

## Phase 1 Close

- PR #24 merged into main. Issues #1–#8 closed.
- All 18 tests passing at merge.
- Scaffold, seed data, routing, theme tokens, Header, Footer, Layout, NotFound — all shipped.

## Directives Captured

1. **Proper git workflow:** Feature branches (`squad/<name>`), PRs against main, issue comments, auto-close with `Closes #N`. No direct commits to main.
2. **Phase gating on tests + PR merge:** All tests must pass and all PRs must be merged before advancing to the next phase.

## Phase 2 Launched

- **McManus:** Building core pages (Episodes list, Episode detail, Guests list, Guest detail, Contact).
- **Keaton:** Writing proactive tests for Phase 2 pages before implementation.
